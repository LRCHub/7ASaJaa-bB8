Style of your hair
Shape of your eyes
and your nose
The way you stare
As if you see
right through to my soul
Its your left hand
and the way
that its not quite
as big as your right
The way you stand
in the mirror
Before we go out at night
A quiet time
your beautiful mind
They're a part of the list
Things that I miss
Things like your
funny little laugh
The way you smile
or the way we kiss
What I noticed is this
I come up with
something new
every single time
That I sit an reminisce
The way you sweet smell
lingers when you leave a room
Stories you tell as we lay
in bed all afternoon
all afternoon
I dreamed you now every night
in my mind is where we meet
in my mind is where we meet
and when I'm awake
staring at pictures
of you asleep
Touching your face
invading you space
They're a part of the list
Things that I miss
Things like your
funny little laugh
The way you smile
or the way we kiss
What I noticed is this
I come up with
something new
every single time
That I sit an reminisce
And you'll live in my memories
forever more I swear
And you'll live in my memories
forever more I swear
They're a part of the list
Things that I miss
Things like your
funny little laugh
The way you smile
or the way we kiss
What I noticed is this
I come up with
something new every single time
That I sit an reminisce
